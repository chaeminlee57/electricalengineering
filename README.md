# Electrical Engineering

The course consists of ~10 labs. In the course, we build things like a full 8-bit adder and a digit displayer using MUX. We also gain experience with Quartus and gain familiarity dealing with VHDL, Verilog, BDF files, BSF, etc. Overall this lab teaches me a lot and I thought I would upload some of the files in the lab on GitHub.
